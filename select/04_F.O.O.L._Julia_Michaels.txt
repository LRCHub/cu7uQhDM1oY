Everybody said that it would, take time
I'd cry, that I'd go through every memory
In my mind and ask why, for a while
Gotta do a little hurting to be fine
With you missing in a instant
It's like I'm out of prison
Nothing's ever felt this good as falling out of love
(Falling out of love)
With you (Oh-oh) mm
Didn't know I'd feel this good
Just laying here alone
But I do (Oh-oh)
And tell me yeah
Aren't there supposed to be pieces that I pick up?
Nobody said that I'd be dancing while breaking up
Nothing's ever felt this good as falling out of love
(Falling out of love)
I don't think I'm heard of someone on track, so fast
Wanting you would be like taking 82 steps back, just like that
How you got me feeling so relaxed?
With you missing in a instant
It's like I'm out of prison
If I added up every moment
It's never gonna come close to this
Nothing's ever felt this good as falling out of love
(Falling out of love)
With you (Oh-oh) mm
Didn't know I'd feel this good
Just laying here alone
But I do (Oh-oh)
And tell me yeah
Aren't there supposed to be pieces that I pick up?
Nobody said that I'd be dancing while breaking up
Nothing's ever felt this good as falling out of love
(Falling out of love)
With you yeah
Hey, I'm hey, I'm
Falling out of love
Hey, I'm hey, I'm
Falling out of love
Hey, I'm hey, I'm
Falling out of love
Hey, I'm hey, I'm
Falling out of love
If I added up every moment
It's never gonna come close to this
Nothing's ever felt this good as falling out of love
(Falling out of love)
With you yeah
Didn't know I'd feel this good
Just laying here alone
But I do
And tell me
Aren't there supposed to be pieces that I pick up?
(Pieces that I'm picking up)
Nobody said that I'd be dancing while breaking up
(Dancing while breaking up)
Nothing's ever felt this good as falling out of love
(Falling out of love)
Out of love, out of love with you
