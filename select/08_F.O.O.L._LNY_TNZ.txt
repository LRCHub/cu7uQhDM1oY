Feeling kinda lonely, Like you no longer know me
Or am I losing myself, I'm out of my depth, yeah
Caught up in the moments
A little scared to leave here broken cus
I wanted to say that we could make it
But my heart doesn't lie, won't let me fake it
I'm blind even with the lights on
One more night I'm holding even tighter
Please don't wake me up, I'm falling out of love
I know we've been in and out of touch
I don't know if you'll be here in the morning
Could you give me a warning, I'm falling out of love
Tell me in the morning, Cus I got tired of talking
No, I'm not acting myself, I'm somebody else, yeah
Thinking we were better, Tryna hold it all together
Cus I don't wanna say another goodbye
It's heavy the way it weighs on my mind
I'm blind even with the lights on
One more night I'm holding even tighter
Please don't wake me up, I'm falling out of love
I know we've been in and out of touch
I don't know if you'll be here in the morning
Could you give me a warning, I'm falling out of love
