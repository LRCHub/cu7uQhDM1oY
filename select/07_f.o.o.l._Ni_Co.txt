I knew exactly what to do the day that I met you
Remember that party?
I knew how to laugh at your humor
You felt so familiar, spent six hours talking

I knew when I knew and
Just like the books and the movies
Just how they said that it would be

Fallin' for you was so easy
It came natural
Like waking up, it felt like breathing
Didn't have to try
And now I'm stranded in this house
Trying to figure this shit out
Falling in was easy
Why did no one ever teach me
How to fall out of love with you, with you?
How to fall out of love with you, with you?

Don't know what I'm supposed to do in a world without you
I miss your body
I don't feel equipped for this part
No one said broken hearts were this hard, it's ungodly

I don't know how to let go
It's not how they said that it would be
Nothing like the books and the movies
(Fallin' for you)

Fallin' for you was so easy
It came natural
Like waking up, it felt like breathing
Didn't have to try
And now I'm stranded in this house
Thinkin' 'bout what would happen now
'Cause falling in was easy
Why did no one ever teach me
How to fall out of love with you, with you?
How to fall out of love with you, with you?

Feel like such a fool (Feel like such a fool)
Don't know how to do this (No, I don't know how to do this)
(Don't know how to do)
Feel like such a fool (Feel like such a fool)
Don't know how to do this (No, I don't know how to do this)
(Don't know how to do)

Fall out of love with you, with you
How to fall out of love with you, with you
